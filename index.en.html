        <h2>Overview</h2>
    </header>

    <p>FlaskFiller is an educational web application for 5th and 6th grade.
    Using FlaskFiller students are able to fill up virtual glasses, like a
    highball glass, a lemonade glass, a cocktail glass, and an Erlenmeyer
    flask. We can describe the filling of a glass with water using two
    quantities: the volume of the water in the glass and the height of the
    water level in the glass. And, of course, time is also changing during the
    whole filling process.</p>
    
    <p>FlaskFiller enables students to explore the relationship between volume,
    height, and time in this situation of change. To explore students have two
    tools: creating a measuring cup of the glass and drawing a graph. The
    measure lines are invisible when the microworld is started, you enable
    them by clicking the <img
    alt="Button to enable/disable the measure lines"
    src="images/align-vertical-center-2.png" />-button. The measure lines
    given can be dragged onto the glass. When running the simulation, students
    can check if they have positioned the measure lines correctly. When the
    lines are positioned incorrectly students are invited to think about the
    situation some more.
    The simulation of the filling of the glass is controlled by the start
    button (<img alt="The start button"
    src="images/media-playback-start.png" />), the pause button (<img alt="The
    pause button"
    src="images/media-playback-pause.png" />) and the clear all (in Dutch
    <em>Leegmaken</em>) button (<img alt="The clear all button"
    src="images/media-skip-backward-7.png" />).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After studying the relation between volume and water level height,
    students can express that relationship by drawing a graph. Click the
    graph button (<img alt="The graph button to enable/disable graphing"
    src="images/chart-curve-edit.png" />) to enable graphing.
    In this empty graph a student can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Draw free hand with a pencil (<img alt="free hand tool"
        src="images/draw-freehand.png" />);</li>
        <li>Draw a straight line using the line-tool (<img alt="line tool"
        src="images/draw-line-3.png" />);</li>
        <li>Mark a point with a cross (<img alt="Point marker"
        src="images/draw-circle.png" />);</li>
        <li>Or clear everything he or she has drawn (<img alt="Clear tool"
        src="images/draw-eraser.png" />).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The students can check their graphs by running the simulation of
        filling the glass again after enabling the automatic graph tool by
        clicking the <img alt="Automatic graph tool"
        src="images/chart-curve-add.png" />-button. Again, seeing their own
        work and the correct graph drawn by the microworld, students are
        invited to think about the differences and what those differences mean
        in terms of change.</p>
    
        <p>
        For some of the pupils it might feel strange to not study change in
        relation to time. Besides the relationship between volume and height,
        the relationship between time and height can also be taken into
        account. To change to time, click the time-button (<img alt="The time
        button to activate time (instead of volume)"
         src="images/clock-add.png" />). A timer will appear and the student
         can draw time verus height graphs.

    FlaskFiller can be easily reset by refreshing the webpage (shortcut F5).

    FlaskFiller is designed for Dutch primary education and the interface is
    in Dutch. On the other hand, text is only sparsely used in
    FlaskFiller.</p>
